# interval-list-intersection
You are given two lists of closed intervals, firstList and secondList, where firstList[i] = [starti, endi] and secondList[j] = [startj, endj]. Each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.  Return the intersection of these two interval lists.  A closed interval [a, b] (with a &lt;= b) denotes the set of real numbers x with a &lt;= x &lt;= b.  The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval. For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].     Example 1:   Input: firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]] Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]] Example 2:  Input: firstList = [[1,3],[5,9]], secondList = [] Output: []    Constraints:  0 &lt;= firstList.length, secondList.length &lt;= 1000 firstList.length + secondList.length >= 1 0 &lt;= starti &lt; endi &lt;= 109 endi &lt; starti+1 0 &lt;= startj &lt; endj &lt;= 109 endj &lt; startj+1
